# hello-world
This is my first repository.

My name is Lucas Maximiliano and I am a first year electrical engineering student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).
I hope to use GitHub as a complementary tool to aid my studies and personal projects in the next few years.
So far it is a very interesting website that I am looking foward to explore!
